# Hand-Detection
The algorithm used is based on deep learning and it employs discriminative model to get the hand representation. It randomizes four coordinate points and put four puzzle pieces on top of those. The software can capture real-time video and provide feedbacks, for example, the lines and points feature to indicate the hand and fingers position. The user/player should put their finger in the middle point of the puzzle piece in order to move them.
